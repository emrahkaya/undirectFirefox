undirect for Firefox
====================

This will be Firefox version of the undirect extension for Chrome, because undirect is the only extension that really works on Chrome, whereas current Firefox addons cannot handle redirects perfectly.

"Undirect is a simple chrome extension that removes this tracking and redirection from google search results.

Works for all google domains across all countries, and is very light-weight."
